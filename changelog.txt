- (render_templates.py) Fixes bug where jinja2 does not get imported from packages folder on school computers. Added "packages" to the system path to fix this.

- (matrix_calculator.html) The above bug may also may have been due to the page not fully loading when dimensions are calculated so added a 1ms time wait before the page is initially resized.
- (page_layout.js) Fixed bug causing buttons to appear below the graph, even in landscape view. Had to take 17 pixels from the equation div width to account for the standard chrome scrollbar width (17px).
