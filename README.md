# Matrix Calculator

A simple calculator that supports the use of matrices/vectors in the calculations.
Includes many common operations e.g. logarithm and trigonometric functions.
It also implements a few more specific ones such as determinant, transpose and cross product etc, that only relate to linear algebra.

# Motivation

This project was initally built as my A-Level final school project over the course of a few months.
Eventually I decided to publish it on GitHub and continue to improve it.
Hope you enjoy!
