<br />
<br />

A simple calculator that supports the use of matrices/vectors in the calculations.
<br />
Includes many common operations e.g. logarithm and trigonometric functions.
<br />
It also implements a few more specific ones such as determinant, transpose and cross product etc, that only relate to linear algebra.
<br />


# Motivation

This was initally built as a school project over the course of a few months.
<br />
I decided to continue to improve it and eventually shared my work to GitHub.
<br />
Hope you enjoy!
